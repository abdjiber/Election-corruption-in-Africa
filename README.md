# Election corruption in Africa

This project is my Capstone project of the IBM's advanced Data Science specialization on Coursera. 

My project was about the prediction of election corruption in Africa using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I used the round 5 of AfroBarometer survey. The machine learning models I implemented are lightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost,
Hist Gradient Boosting (from scikit-learn) and Explainable Boosting (interpret ML of microsoft).

I used the accuracy, recall and area under the curve scores and the execution time to compare the performances of the models 
in supervised learning and semi-supervised learning. While some models performance decreased in the semi-supervised learning, 
the one of other models remained the same.
